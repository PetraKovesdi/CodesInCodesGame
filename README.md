# Codes in Codes Game

## Story


This is a game, I thought of while I was in my very early stage of learning programming and web development. 
It will have 11 puzzles and a last ending page with some extra.:-)
The puzzles are about looking into the frontend code for finding a number. 
In the first 4 puzzles finding this 6-digit number will be direct and easy, later on this number will be a bit more hidden,
but I do not plan to make these puzzles extra hard.

I'm far from finishing this, but working on it.:-)

I appreciate if you send me some feedback, how you liked it. Was it hard or easy?
